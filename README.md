## My Portfolio Hub

A portfolio is an extremely important part of any career, so why not make one really tailored to me that also shows what i can do? After all, what better way to show off your skills than to make your resume with them? This site is a hub to keep track of anything i create and will continue to expand as time goes on.

## Made in React

### Future Goals:
- update resume
- add printable pdf/word doc resume
- add more projects
- add nav bar for easier navigation between pages
- figure out if external links can be embedded into project so the nav bar will still appear even if user clicks a link?
- implement preview thumbnail for project links
- make intro be outside like a card and then flip open, kinda like how dani did her resume cuz its cool. maybe click picture and have it open and expand or have a nav wheel?
- make section to display physical art portfolio as well, maybe like a catalogue?
